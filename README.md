# 📝 RustNotes

**RustNotes** is a fast, lightweight, and file-based note-taking application built in Rust. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for creating, viewing, and searching plain-text notes—designed for developers and terminal lovers who value simplicity and speed.

## 🚀 Purpose

This project was created to explore Rust’s capabilities for building practical tools and to offer a minimal yet powerful way to take and manage notes directly from the terminal.

RustNotes saves your notes as individual files and enables quick keyword-based searches to help you find what you’ve written—without fancy databases or unnecessary overhead.

## 🎯 Features

- 📄 Create and save notes to disk
- 🔍 Search notes by keywords
- 📜 View all saved notes
- 🗑 Delete notes
- 🧱 Simple, readable CLI structure

> All notes are stored locally in a `notes/` directory with optional tagging support planned for future updates.
